to Mechanical Power </u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Power can be
defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of change of energy. It
is a kinetic variable that is very useful in the mechanics of human
movement.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+2">Average Power</font></p>
<p><img src="power1.jpg" align="middle" height="80" width="480"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;<br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The
reason that
this quantity is called average power is that work is not an
instantaneous value. It requires a finite period of time over which the
work was done. Average power is a useful measure in the human movement
sciences because many sports require work to be done as quickly as
possible.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example: How
much
arm power is required for a 70 kg person to climb an 8 meter rope in 20
seconds?</font></p>
<p><img src="power2.jpg" align="middle" height="160" width="650"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">For many human
performance activities, the ability to do work in the shortest period
of
time is paramount. &nbsp;Aerobic power is often measured as an
important determinant of performance in endurance events and Anaerobic
power is important for activities lasting between 30 seconds and a few
minutes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+2">Instantaneous
Power</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">Another way of
measuring power is to multiply force and velocity or to use calculus to
get the rate of change of energy.
</font></p>
<p><img src="power3.jpg" align="middle" height="70" width="325"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">In the previous
lecture on energy, we saw that the energy of a limb segment can be
calculated at each instant in time. &nbsp;We can use these measures
to calculate segment power using the central finite difference method
of differentiation that we learned in the laboratory section.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="+1">We
will use the example of calculating the power of a thigh segment at
frame 60 of a video analysis using the data from frames 59 and 61.</font></p>
<p><img src="power4.jpg" align="middle" height="550" width="750"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Muscle power can
be calculated as the product of the net joint moment of force and the
segment angular velocity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This next
examples shows the calculation of the instantaneous power of the elbow
flexors.</font></p>
<p><img src="power5.jpg" align="middle" height="220" width="435"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A negative muscle
power indicates an eccentric contraction. &nbsp;Notice that the flexor
muscles are active but the elbow is extending .</font></p>
