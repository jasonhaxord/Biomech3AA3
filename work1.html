Balance</u></font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Muscular
contraction involves the conversion of metabolic energy (via caloric
expenditure) into mechanical energy so that mechanical work can be
performed. In the previous lecture, we defined several types of
mechanical energy and broadly defined energy as the ability to perform
work. This lecture defines work and shows the balance between work and
energy</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Work can be
defined as the product of force and distance and it is equal to a
change in energy.</font></p>


<p><img src="work1.jpg" align="middle" height="90" width="290"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Positive work
occurs when the force and motion are in the same direction.
&nbsp;Negative work is done when they are in opposite directions.
&nbsp;Lifting a weight is an example of positive work and lowering
a
weight is an example of negative work. &nbsp;When positive work is
performed, energy increases. &nbsp;When negative work is performed,
energy is decreased.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Example:</font></p>


<p><img src="WORK1B.jpg" align="right" height="503" width="654"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A runner must
perform extra work when running up a hill compared to running on level
ground because the runner's potential energy increases. Calculate the
extra work by an 80 kg runner on a treadmill set at a 10% grade who
runs at a speed of 6 km/hr for 30 minutes.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Solution:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A 10% grade
means
that the slope is such that for every 100 m of horizontal displacement,
the vertical displacement is 10 m. The angle of the incline is
&Oslash; =
tan<sup>-1</sup>(rise/run)
= tan<sup>-1</sup>(0.10)
= 5.71 degrees.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Since the runner
has a speed of 6 km/hr and a time of one half hour,&nbsp;he runs
for
3000 m (6000 m x 0.5 = 3000). The hypotenuse of the triangle is 3000m
and the angle is 5.71 degrees. Therefore, the rise = 3000 sin5.71<sup>o
</sup>= &nbsp;298.5m.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The potential
energy gained is m.g.h = 80(9.81)(298.5) = 234kJ.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Work
Performed
on a Human Body Segment:</big></font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can calculate
how much work is done on a human body segment by calculating the change
in the segment's energy. &nbsp;In the example below, we look at the
energy of a thigh segment during a walking stride at two points in time.</font></p>


<p><img src="work2.jpg" align="middle" height="532" width="700"></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The energy of
the
thigh segment has changed from 48.8 J to 47.1 J which means that work
has been performed on the segment. &nbsp;The amount of work is
equal to
the change in energy. &nbsp;Work = 47.1 - 48.8 = - 1.7 J</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Therefore 1.7 J
of
negative work was performed on the thigh segment.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Notice, also
that
the potential energy increased from 36.2 J to 38.3 J while the kinetic
energy was reduced from 12.6 J (12.2+0.4) to 8.8 J (8.6+0.2).
&nbsp;There has been a transfer of energy within the segment from
kinetic to potential much like the energy conservation of a pendulum.
&nbsp;Some of the lost kinetic energy has been used to increase the
potential energy but 1.7 J of negative work was still required to
reduce the kinetic energy further. &nbsp;On the next page we will
see
that energy can not only be transfered within a segment but also
between segments.</font></p>
