Analysis of Human Movement</u></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to analyze
human movement quantitatively, we must measure human movement.
&nbsp;There are many different methods used in biomechanics to
perform
motion capture. &nbsp;For a closer examination of these methods see
the&nbsp;<a href="DataCollection1.html">"Motion
Capture"</a> lecture.
The most common method of measuring human movement is to use
film or video recordings with a method called "motion
capture".&nbsp;This lab presents the steps required to produce a
video
tape or film that can be quantified and the typical method of making
the measurements.</font></p>

<p><img src="Data1.jpg" align="right" height="461" width="177"> </p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>The
Biomechanical Film or Video:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">There are only two
variables that can be measured by a video or film analysis.
&nbsp;These
two variables are position and time. &nbsp;However, if we are
careful
about how we produce the video, we can derive many other variables
such as joint angles, velocities, accelerations, centers of mass, etc.
&nbsp;The following is a list of requirements:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Camera Placement:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A single camera
limits the biomechanist to a planar analysis. &nbsp;So the camera
must
be placed perpendicular to the plane of motion.<br>

The camera should be stationary so that any motion from one frame to
the next would be due to the&nbsp;movement of the subject.
&nbsp;Quite
often, the camera is placed on a tripod and leveled so that the
vertical axis will be in line with gravity and the height of the camera
is at the middle of the frame. &nbsp;Since the camera cannot zoom
in or
out during filming, it must be paced far enough away so as to "see" the
required frame in its entirety. &nbsp;There are methods of using a
panning or moving camera but they require a calibrated background such
that the position and orientation of the camera can be calculated for
each frame.</font></p>

<p><img src="DataCollection3.jpg" align="right" height="259" width="300"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Body segment
landmarks are normally placed on the subject in a biomechanical
analysis so
that joint centers can be digitized more easily. Often, the markers are
reflective tape so when a spotlight is shined on the subject, the
video shows bright lights at each marker that is really the reflected
light from the spotlight.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3) The image needs
to be scaled to life size using an object of known size in the plane of
motion. &nbsp;Often, a meter stick or calibrated object of known
size
is placed in the field of view <span style="font-weight: bold;">and
in the plane of motion</span>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">4) Exact timing
information of frame rate is needed to establish velocity and
acceleration. &nbsp;A falling object in the
background was used in the old days but this was replaced by light
emitting diodes within the cameras and the quartz technology used in
modern watches ensures exact precise frame rate in today's video
cameras.</font></p>

<p align="left"><big><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><big>Digitization Example:</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In the example
below, a camera was set to record the sagittal plane view of a person
performing a standing long jump. A meter stick has been placed as a
scale and eight frames are shown that were recorded at 1/15 second
intervals. The actual recording had many more frames but we will only
look at these few for simplicity. The digital images can be analyzed
using a computer screen and a mouse.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><img src="Jump.jpg" align="middle" height="394" width="962"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If we look at frame
6, we can see that the person is at the point of take-off. We wish to
calculate the linear take-off velocity. We need to find the coordinates
of the marker in frame 6 and in frame 7, scale the coordinates to life
size and then find the rate of change.</font></p>

<p><img src="Jump2.jpg" align="left" height="538" width="310"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can take the white marker on the floor to be the
(0,0) coordinate. The marker on the subject has the coordinates of (69,
105) units in Frame 6 and (96, 132) in Frame 7. These coordinates must
be converted to life size units in meters. To do this, we use the meter
stick which is 110 units long in the images. Since 110 units is equal
to one meter in life size, we divide the coordinates by 110 to get
(0.627, 0.955) m in Frame 6 and (0.823, 1.200)m in Frame 7.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We can see that the marker on the subject has moved
upward and to the right from Frame 6 to Frame 7 and we can use the
coordinates to calculate the displacement. In the horizontal direction,
the displacement is 0.823 - 0.627 = 0.196 m. The displacement in the
vertical direction is 1.200 - 0.955 = 0.245 m. We would then use
Pythagoras to find the resultant displacement. In this case it would be
the square root of (0.196<sup style="font-weight: bold;">2</sup>
+ 0.245<sup style="font-weight: bold;">2</sup>)
= 0.314 m.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to find the velocity, we would divide the
displacement by the time between frames. Since the time between frames
was given as 1/15 seconds, We would divide 0.314 by 1/15 which is equal
to 0.314(15) = 4.71 m/s.</font></p>

Photography for Biomechanists</big></font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Whether the image
to be analyzed is from a still or video camera, there are some basic
rules and techniques that every biomechanist should know in order to
obtain a clear, high quality image.</font></p>

<p><img src="DataCollection2b.jpg" align="right" height="226" width="900"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Aperture and
Exposure Time:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Aperture refers to
the size of opening that the lens uses to allow light expose film or
reach the CCD of a digital camera. &nbsp;It is measured in f-stops
with
the larger numbers (settings) being used when a lot of light is present
and lower numbers are used in low light situations. &nbsp;For
example f/8 is often used outdoors in sunlight while f/2.8 or lower is
often
used
indoors with room lighting. Another factor that affects the
amount of light that hits the film or CCD is the exposure time which is
regulated by the shutter speed. &nbsp;The shutter opens to the set
aperture for a period of time and then closes. &nbsp;In
biomechanics,
this exposure time is measured in a fraction of a second. &nbsp;The
scientist must choose a time that is sufficiently short to prevent
motion blur yet sufficiently long to get a proper exposure.
&nbsp;If
the&nbsp;time is too short, the image will be under exposed and be
too
dark. &nbsp; Therefore, it is important to choose the best aperture
and exposure time to yield an image that is sufficiently bright without
motion blur. &nbsp;Still photography often uses a flash to increase
the
amount of light such that a short exposure time can be used and in
video, extra lights such as flood lights or TV lights are used.
&nbsp;A
shutter speed of 1/100th of a second is often sufficient for walking
and slower movements while 1/500th or higher is often used for more
dynamic movements. &nbsp;The biomechanist first considers the
motion to
be captured and selects the shutter speed required. &nbsp;Then
using a
light meter, selects an aperture that will allow a proper exposure.
&nbsp;If there is not enough light, extra light must be used or the
ISO
can be altered.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Depth of Field (DOF):</font></p>

<p><img src="Photography3.jpg" align="left" height="396" width="599"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The depth of field refers to the range of distances
from the camera that will be in focus. Objects that are closer or
further away from this range will not be in focus. Notice in the figure
to the left that the white chess pieces are in focus. However, if light
was low and the photographer needed to open the aperture to f/2, the
depth of field is small and the black chess pieces are not in focus.
The depth of field is quite small at f/2 which means that only a narrow
range of objects will be in focus. If more light is available, and an
aperture of f/16 can be used, both the white and black pieces are in
focus because the depth of field is larger. The biomechanist must be
careful to ensure that all objects that need to be digitized are in
focus. It is possible for the right arm to be in focus but the left arm
is not in focus of a sagittal plane image like the baseball player
above.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">ISO:</font></p>

<p><img src="Photography2.jpg" align="left" height="331" width="499"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The ISO is another
way to alter the exposure. &nbsp;It increases the sensitivity of
the
CCD to light. &nbsp;A typical value of 100 is used but if the
biomechanist finds that the movement requires a shutter speed of 1/500
and the largest aperture of the lens is f/4.0 which does not allow
enough
light, the ISO can be increased to 400 which allows the available light
to make a brighter image. &nbsp;Modern cameras allow ISO
settings
of 6400 or even higher which enables fast shutter settings in low light
but the image quality becomes noisy or grainy so care should be taken
when using ISO as a means to deal with low light. The added benefit of
using a supplementary light source like a&nbsp;spot light near the
camera is that it tends to fill in shadows that might obscure a joint
marker even if the overall image is properly exposed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Auto Focus:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The other crucial
aspect to image quality is the sharpness of the image. &nbsp;Since
biomechanical filming is concerned with the plane of motion, the
subject is always the same distance from the camera and focus does not
need to change. &nbsp;Therefore, the auto focus function should be
turned off so the camera does not get confused by anything moving in
the background or foreground.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="Data2.jpg" align="right" height="461" width="519"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Focal Length (Zoom):</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The focal length is
also an important consideration. Most people are familiar with a zoom
lens that allows a closer view of the subject but this also has
complications. The focal length is measured in millimeters with a focal
length of 80mm being approximately equal to the view from a human eye.
A wide angle lens (&lt;50 mm) increases distortion called the
"barrel
effect" which can be quite extreme (think of a "fish-eye" lens or the
security peep hole in a door). A longer lens (&gt; 200mm) has less
distortion but is harder to hold steady and requires a high shutter
speed to prevent motion blur from an unsteady hand. Modern lens
technology uses "image stabilization" to reduce this problem but
biomechanics places the camera on a fixed tripod and does not suffer
from hand motion or require image stabilization. Often, a longer lens
cannot handle apertures
larger than f/4.0 which also means more light or a higher ISO is
required. However, since perspective distortion is less, the flatter
image (long focal length) is
preferred in biomechanics. Cameras that provide optical zoom without
actually changing the focal length achieve the "zoom in" effect by
reducing the resolution of the image. As the resolution of digital
cameras increases, this becomes less of a concern.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="Data3.jpg" align="right" height="398" width="286"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Resolution:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A typical HD video camera has a resolution of 1080
x 1920 picture elements (called pixels). If the image is displayed on a
computer monitor or tablet with equal or greater resolution, no
resolution is lost If the monitor has a lower resolution, then the
resolution of the digitization will be that of the monitor. If the
digitization is made by a human positioning a cursor over the marker on
the human subject, The resolution can be further limited by the visual
acuity of the person digitizing. Typically, the human eye has a visual
resolution of about 170 pixels per inch when viewing the monitor from a
distance of 20 inches. Therefore, if the digital display is smaller
than 6.5 x 11.3 inches, the resolution of the digitization would also
be reduced. Most computer displays are larger than this so the
resolution of the digitization is that of the raw image.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">If the camera was positioned so that the field of
view was 2 m tall, then the resolution would be 1 pixel equals
2000/1080 = 1.85 mm of life size. This means that our digitized
coordinates are&nbsp;&plusmn;2 mm. The actual marker is
considerably larger than this and so we estimate the center of the
marker.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The image to the right is a portion of the left leg
of the baseball player shown at the top of this page. The original
resolution was about 6mm of life size per pixel and when we magnify to
the point where we can easily see the pixels, we can see that each
marker has several pixels even at this rather low resolution. A human
digitization would be able to select the pixel closest to the center of
the marker even if the marker was slightly out of focus or under
exposed or if there was digital noise from a high ISO. Motion blur
would be a problem but perfect lighting, depth of
field or sharp focusing is of less concern.</font></p>

<p align="left"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Bottom Line:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The more light you
have, the greater freedom you have to choose aperture, exposure time,
ISO, depth of field and focal length. The laboratory setting usually
allows extra light from spot lights to be used but many field settings
do not and the biomechanist must be prepared to manipulate all of these
factors to get the best&nbsp;image possible. Motion blur is worse
than out-of-focus blur, perfect exposure, or image noise. Therefore it
is most important to have an exposure time short enough to prevent
motion blur and then adjust light, aperture and ISO to get a proper
exposure.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Results of Experiment 1:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A camera was placed 3.2 meters from the plane of
motion. Two meter sticks were placed on the floor 0.5 m apart. An
aperture of f/4.0 was selected and the exposure time was adjusted to
get a proper exposure using the room light. A spot light of 1000 W was
then projected and a new exposure time was found.</font></p>

<p><img src="Data4.jpg" align="middle" height="271" width="819"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The images&nbsp;above show that the additional
light allowed the exposure time to be reduced from 1/5 to 1/30 of a
second. The addition of the spot light allowed a shutter speed that was
6 times faster and would result in a sixth of the motion blur.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Results of Experiment 2:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">While the camera was at the 3.2 m placing, a focal
length of 24 mm was used. The camera was then re-positioned to a
distance of 10 m and a new focal length of 80 mm was found to have the
same field of view.</font></p>

<p><img src="Data5.jpg" align="middle" height="271" width="788"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The images above show that the perspective error is
considerable less when the camera was placed at 10 m. The two meter
sticks appear to be at different lengths and the Y coordinate of the
meter stick farthest from the camera would be greater even though both
sticks are on the floor.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Results of Experiment 3:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">A subject stood in the plane of motion and
performed several arm swings. The camera was set an ISO of 100 and an
exposure time 1/15 second. With each subsequent arm swing, the ISO was
increased to 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200. Each time the ISO was
doubled a new exposure time of 1/2 the previous time was used.</font></p>

<p><img src="Data6.jpg" align="right" height="503" width="642"> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The images on the
right show that each time the ISO
was increased, the exposure time could be decreased and the motion blur
was
reduced. Image A had an ISO setting of 100 which required an exposure
time of 1/6 s. The exposure is not too dark but the motion blur is
extreme. Image B had an ISO setting of 400 which makes the CCD 4 times
more sensitive to light than ISO 100. An exposure time of 1/30 s
reduced the motion blur by 5 times but it is still not acceptable for
accurate digitizing of the subject's hands. Image C increased the ISO
to 6400 which is 16 times more sensitive than Image B. An exposure time
of 1/400 s reduced the motion blur to a more acceptable amount. Image D
has the same ISO as Image C but the addition of the spot light allowed
an exposure time of 1/2500 s and an almost total elimination of motion
blur. If you look closely at images C and D you can see an increase in
noise when compared to Image A but this would not impair a digitization
of a marker on the hands.</font></p>
