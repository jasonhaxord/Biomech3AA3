Analysis of Human Movement</u></font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">There are three
approaches to the analysis of human movement. &nbsp;These have been
termed "subjective", "objective", and "predictive". &nbsp;The
predictive approach asks the question: "What if ..." and involves
computer simulations and forward dynamics that are covered in advanced
topics. &nbsp;The objective approach involves measurement of
kinematics
and the calculation of forces and moments that
cause&nbsp;movement like we did in the static equilibrium lecture
and we will continue in dynamic&nbsp;equilibrium later.
&nbsp;This lecture is concerned with the subjective
analysis
of human movement in which subjective estimates are made and
biomechanical principles are applied without exact measurements and
sophisticated equipment.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1) Summation of Joint Torques:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">When we wish to move an object, we must apply a
force to it. We know that our muscles generate moments of force or
torques about joint centers to achieve this. For any given task, we can
ask the question "Am I using all of the available muscle groups to
maximize the summation of joint torques?".</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2) Continuity of Joint Torques:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The answer to the above question might be "yes" but
the timing of those applied joint torques may not be optimal for the
desired performance. Therefore, we need to ask the question "Do the
joint torques have the proper timing or sequence?". Throwing a ball
has proximal-to-distal sequence of shoulder, then elbow, then wrist
while the vertical jump requires a near simultaneous timing of hip knee
and ankle extension.</font></p>


<p><img src="Qualitative3.jpg" align="right" height="203" width="368"> </p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3) Impulse -
Momentum:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Momentum is equal to mass times velocity and
impulse is equal to a change in momentum. In many activities the object
is to generate the greatest impulse in order to maximize a change in
momentum (i.e. throwing a ball as hard or as far as you can). Impulse
is also equal to force times time so you ask the question: Are the
forces being applied for as long as possible?". One way to apply forces
for a longer period of time is to maximize the range of motion.</font></p>

<p><img src="Qualitative4.jpg" align="right" height="308" width="399"> </p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">4) Action -
Reaction:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Newton's third law states that for each action
there is an equal but opposite reaction. In order to jump as high as
possible, we push downward against the ground and it is the ground's
reaction on us the causes us to accelerate upward. A baseball pitcher
pushes off the ground in order to throw a ball forcefully. If the
pitcher were to jump in the air and then try to throw the ball, the
force on the ball would not be so large. The arm forces could be the
same but the contribution from the legs would be gone because contact
with the ground was lost. We should also think of friction when using
this principle.</font></p>

<p><img src="Qualitative1.jpg" align="right" height="609" width="999"> </p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">5) Equilibrium, Balance and Stability:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">We have already looked at static equilibrium in
this course in which all of the forces and moments balanced to zero.
&nbsp;In a dynamic situation, the forces and moments often do not
balance to zero and this can cause objects to fall or move in an
undesirable fashion. The stability of an object is often simplistically
looked at by the "righting moment". That is to say the moment of force
required to maintain an upright position. If we look at the diagram of
bar stools to the right, we can see that the larger the base of support
and/or the lower the center of mass, the more stable the object is.
When the stools are tilted the same amount, the stool with smallest
base of support and the stool with the highest CofG both would require
an additional moment to keep from falling while gravity provides an
adequate righting moment for the other stools.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This definition of stability is not sufficient for
human stability or any system with dynamic control. If you are walking
along a very narrow path such as tightrope or railway track, it easier
for you to keep your balance by raising your arms out to the side. The
base of support has not been changed and you have actually raised your
CofG&nbsp;and yet you are<span style="font-weight: bold;">
more</span> stable not less. The reason for this is that you have
increased your moment of inertia which decreases your tenancy to
rotate and gives you more time to make corrections (righting moments)
before losing your balance. Similarly, a spinning top is more stable
then a stationary top and it is much easier to keep a bicycle balanced
while it is moving than when it stops.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">6) Summation of Body segment Velocities:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Similar to the summation of joint torques, velocity
vectors add and if the desired movement is not achieved, we can look to
see which body segment did not have the expected magnitude and
direction of velocity.</font></p>


<p><img src="Qualitative8.jpg" align="right" height="300" width="490"> </p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">7) Production of
Rotational Momentum:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">In order to produce rotational momentum, we must
generate angular impulse which is applying a large moment of force over
a long period of time. The springboard diver shown to the right uses
the flex in the board to store energy and then exert a large reaction
force on the diver over a longer period of time. As mentioned earlier,
force over longer periods of time increase impulse and a change in
momentum. If that reaction force was directed through the center of
mass of the diver, it would not produce any rotation. In this case, the
diver is attempting a front 2.5 somersault in the pike position and
must generate a large angular or rotational momentum. To achieve this,
the reaction force from the board must the directed posterior to the
center of mass thereby generating a large moment of force over a long
period of time.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">8) Conservation
of
Momentum and Energy Transfer:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Momentum is conserved in&nbsp;collisions or
impacts. When two objects collide there is often a transfer of energy
from one object to the other as one object loses momentum and the other
object increases momentum by the same amount. A smaller player could
have the same momentum as a larger player if the smaller player has a
higher velocity. If the two players have the same momentum in opposite
directions, the total momentum is zero. If these two players collide,
the momentum remains zero, both players stop, and the smaller player
has managed to stop the larger player by virtue of having a higher
velocity.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Energy can be transferred between limb segments.
When you walk and swing your leg forward, it reaches full knee
extension and as your leg slows down, it pulls the thigh forward. There
has been a transfer of energy from the leg to the thigh causing a hip
flexion without requiring work to be performed by the hip flexor
muscles.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Momentum is also conserved in the airborne phase of
the running long jump. From projectile motion, we know that horizontal
velocity is constant (neglecting air resistance) but if the jumper
could lose mass, the velocity would be increased. This can be
demonstrated by performing the long jump while carrying weights in your
hands. You can add about 10% of your body weight and run at almost 100%
of your speed without the weights. This will result in a greater
momentum at takeoff and if you throw the weights backward while you are
in the air, your velocity will increase because the momentum must
remain the same. This will result in a further jump.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">9) Manipulation
of
Rotational Inertia:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The previous example of the long jumper throwing
weights backward may seem a bit ridiculous but this effect is used
often in the rotational world. In the linear world, increasing and
decreasing mass is quite difficult but in the rotational world,
increasing and decreasing rotational inertia (moment of inertia) is
very easy. Rotational inertia is dependent on the amount of mass and
how
that mass is distributed about the axis of rotation.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The video clip uses a frictionless rotating
platform to demonstrate this effect. The axis of rotation is a vertical
axis and if a person stands on the platform, their rotational momentum
is zero. &nbsp;They can swing their arms in one direction but the
rest of their body rotates in the opposite direction such that any
positive momentum is canceled by an equal negative momentum. The only
way to generate rotational momentum is to exert a force away from the
axis and the person does this by pushing off the desk. Once the hand is
no longer in contact with the desk the rotational momentum remains
constant. However, the person can increase or decrease the rotational
velocity by increasing and decreasing the rotational momentum by
redistributing the mass toward or away from the axis of rotation. This
redistribution of mass only requires the ability to move the arms
closer
to the axis or further away from the axis.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The springboard diver mentioned above uses the
reaction force from the board to generate rotational momentum, Once in
the air, contact with the board is lost and no further rotational
momentum can be generated and the rotational&nbsp;momentum is
conserved
(constant). By assuming a pike position, the speed of rotation
increases because the mass has been redistributed closer to the
transverse axis about which the diver is rotating. A tuck position
brings the mass even closer to the axis and rotation speed is even
faster.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">10)
Manipulation
of Segmental Rotational Momentum:</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The video for the previous principle showed a
person on a frictionless platform with no angular momentum and the only
way they could generate angular momentum was to push off the desk.
Watch the clip below to see a person complete a full revolution without
pushing off the desk. How is this possible?</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Air resistance is not the answer - this move can be
performed in a vacuum. At no point was rotational momentum generated</font></p>

Movement Analysis Flow Chart</big></font></big></p>


<p><img src="Qualitative10.jpg" align="left" height="908" width="708"> </p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The flow chart to the left is a handy guide to help
improvement of human movement. It shows the four stages that a movement
practitioner should follow. The practitioner could be a coach helping
an athlete, a therapist helping a patient or an ergonomist helping with
workplace tasks.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The first stage is the pre-observation stage and
requires the identification of the mechanical variables involved in a
movement using the principles that we introduced above. Once the
practitioner has decided what to look for, the observation plan can be
decided such as the point of view or to use video recording, etc.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The second stage is to make the observation and
compare the desired movement to the observed movement.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The Analysis phase involves identifying and ranking
the errors and then using the principles above to speculate on the
causes of those errors. It is important to rank those errors and choose
which one to work on first.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Finally, the Remediation phase is the communication
of the error and the suggested strategy that may lead to an improvement
in the performance. Following the intervention, the movement is
observed again in a continuous process that will hopefully cycle toward
a consistently better performance.</font></p>
